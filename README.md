Handy snippets of code for Arduino projects.

This isn't offical code, and even more than usual, is unsupported.  However, there are handy functions and libraries that we're collecting over time to make little tasks easier on Arduino projects and this is somewhere to put them.

And given that they're useful for us, they might be useful for others.  So in the spirit of sharing, we might as well store them in public, where other people can reuse bits themselves.
